##Overview

This repository contains solutions to basic Python programming tasks, including the use of for and while loops.

###Task 1: Create a Shape Using a for Loop

In this task, a shape similar to a triangle is created using a for loop. The shape consists of 10 rows, where the number of stars (*) in each row gradually increases.

####Task 2: Using a while loop

A program is executed using a while loop, where the variables (x and y) start with different values. The loop continues until the two values ​​become equal (x == y). The value of x is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
